Work from Week 3 to Week 7 at the Dojo on the Python and the two most popular web frameworks â€“ Flask and Django. The focus was to get accustomed with the language through algorithm and OOP practice. Then practicing sending and receiving data to and from the client and models/database integration (SQLite) with the micro-framework, Flask. We then proceeded into Django and its MTV architecture, using MySQL to build social-media styled user-based simple, yet all-encompassing web apps.
